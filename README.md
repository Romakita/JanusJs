# JanusJs

A minimalist janusjs implementation exposing core apis similar to flutter_janus_client v2

## What it does?

this repo includes src file JanusJs and public directory which contains single file index.html which implements videoroom example using core api and vanila js just to illustrate how multistream support can be implemented in other javascript projects or even if you are interested in implementing your own custom janus library utilizing JanusJs's core api (minimal stack without webrtc code)
